# Why Pac-Man Goes Right : Explaining Neural Network Decision Making
A Carleton College comps project by Adam Bigelow, Blake Johnson, Brandon Moy, Peter Richieri, Oliver Staten, and Wesley Noss

This project is based off of [code from UC Berkeley](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) designed for designing Pac-Man AIs. In this implementation, we have worked to generate rationales for neural nets. To do so, we have 3 different approaches and 3 different neural nets.

### AI

Our two main gameplay agents are a perceptron and a q-learning neural net.

### Explanations

To create explanations, we have a hard-coded heuristic, observing the perceptron weights with no intermediary, and a q-learning neural net which works independently of the gameplaying agent.

### Dependencies

Python 2.7

TKinter
