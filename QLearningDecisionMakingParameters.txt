Parameters and Guidelines for Evaluation of Decision Making TRAINING

Closest Food Group:
  A small food group is defined as one containing 4 or fewer food pieces
  Closest food group is defined as one containing 5 or more adjacent food pieces
  that is closest to PacMan
  - If small food group is offered as explanation for what should be a closest, mark 5.
  - If closest food group is offered as explanation for what should be a small, mark 5.
  - Food group is usually the default motive if PacMan is not actively interacting
    with ghosts or seeking out a nearby capsule.
  - *Something about tendency to go for small or close food groups*

Capsule:
  Capsules exist in both corners; PacMan tends to take a beeline straight
  for the capsule each time, and generally prioritizes them very highly.
  However, for the sake of consistency, only mark the capsule as a primary
  motive (1 or 2) if PacMan is within 7 of the capsule.  Otherwise, mark not
  good motive (4 or 5).

Ghost 0:
Ghost 1:
  You can generally tell which ghost is ghost 1 or 0 by measuring how far each
  one is from PacMan.
  Ghosts should be considered primary (1 or 2) if they are within 4 of pacman.
  Otherwise, 5-7 might be a 3, 8+ is 4 or 5.
